# Login and Registration System

The Login and Registration System is a basic C++ program that allows users to register with a username and password and then login using their credentials. It provides functionalities to register new users and authenticate existing users.

## Getting Started

To run the Login and Registration System, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/AmrSayed0/login-registration-system).

2. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ login_registration_system.cpp -o login_registration_system
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./login_registration_system
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a simple console-based user interface for the login and registration system. The following actions can be performed:

1. **Register a new user**: To register a new user, you need to provide a unique username and a password.

2. **Login**: To log in, enter your username and password. The system will authenticate your credentials and provide a success or failure message accordingly.

## Example Usage

```
Welcome to the Login and Registration System!

Register a new user:
Enter your username: user1
Enter your password: password1
User registration successful!

Login:
Enter your username: user1
Enter your password: password1
Login successful!
```

## Security Considerations

Please note that this is a simplified implementation for educational purposes and does not include robust security measures like password hashing or data encryption. In a real-world scenario, you should implement additional security measures to ensure the safety of user data and passwords.
