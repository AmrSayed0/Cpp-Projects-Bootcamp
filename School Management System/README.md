1. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/AmrSayed0/school-management-system).

2. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ school_management_system.cpp -o school_management_system
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a simple console-based user interface for managing student records. The following actions can be performed:

1. **Add a student**: To add a student, you need to provide their Student ID, Name, Age, and Grade.

2. **Remove a student**: To remove a student from the system, you need to enter their Student ID.

3. **Search for a student**: To search for a specific student, you need to provide their Student ID. If the student exists, their details will be displayed.
