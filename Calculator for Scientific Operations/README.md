# Calculator for Scientific Operations

The Calculator for Scientific Operations is a simple C++ program that provides basic arithmetic operations along with some common scientific functions, including trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent) and logarithmic functions.

## Getting Started

To use the Calculator for Scientific Operations, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/AmrSayed0/calculator-for-scientific-operations).

2. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ calculator_scientific_operations.cpp -o calculator_scientific_operations
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./calculator_scientific_operations
   ```

## Supported Operations

The calculator supports the following operations:

- Addition (+): Adds two numbers together.
- Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second number from the first number.
- Multiplication (\*): Multiplies two numbers.
- Division (/): Divides the first number by the second number.
- Sine (s): Calculates the sine of an angle in radians.
- Cosine (c): Calculates the cosine of an angle in radians.
- Tangent (t): Calculates the tangent of an angle in radians.
- Logarithm (l): Calculates the logarithm of a number with a given base.
- Natural logarithm (n): Calculates the natural logarithm of a number (base e).

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter the first number and the operation you want to perform. Depending on the operation, you may need to provide additional inputs (e.g., second number, base for logarithm). The program will then calculate the result and display it.

## Example Usage

```
Scientific Calculator
Enter the first number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /, s for sine, c for cosine, t for tangent, l for logarithm, n for natural logarithm): t
Result: -3.38052
```
