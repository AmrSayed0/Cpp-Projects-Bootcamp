# Stock Management System

The Stock Management System is a basic C++ program that allows users to manage a list of products and their stock quantities. It provides functionalities to add products, remove products, update product stock quantities, search for products, and display all products.

## Getting Started

To run the Stock Management System, you need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Follow the steps below to get started:

1. Clone the repository or download the source code from [GitHub](https://github.com/your_username/stock-management-system).

2. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler:

   ```bash
   g++ stock_management_system.cpp -o stock_management_system
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./stock_management_system
   ```

## Usage

Upon running the program, you will be presented with a simple console-based user interface for managing the stock of products. The following actions can be performed:

1. **Add a product**: To add a product, you need to provide its Product ID, Name, Price, and Initial Stock Quantity.

2. **Remove a product**: To remove a product from the stock, you need to enter its Product ID.

3. **Update product stock quantity**: To update the stock quantity of a product, you need to enter its Product ID and the new stock quantity.

4. **Search for a product**: To search for a specific product, you need to provide its Product ID. If the product exists, its details will be displayed.

5. **Display all products**: This option displays a list of all products and their information.
